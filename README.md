# 💫 About Me:
Hello everyone! I'm Mariana, a student of Data Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. Since I discovered the fascinating world of data, I have not been able to stop exploring it and learning more every day.<br><br>I love working with data and finding creative ways to get the most out of it. One of the things I enjoy most is creating dashboards that are not only informative, but also visually appealing and easy to understand. I strongly believe in the importance of communicating the findings of data analysis in a clear and concise way, and I am always looking for new ways to achieve this.
